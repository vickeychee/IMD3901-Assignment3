# IMD3901-Assignment3

**Overview**

The application that I created is a two-player color playback game. Player 1 is shown a series of colors on a ring object on their screen. Player 1 must playback those colors in the correct order by pressing the corresponding-colored buttons in front of them. If done correctly, Player 1 will earn points. However, if done incorrectly, Player 1 will lose points and must start a new round of colors. 

When Player 1 plays a correct series of colors, Player 2 must memorize this as the colors Player 1 chooses will be displayed on the ring in front of Player 2. If Player 2 can play back the sequence correctly using the correct corresponding-colored buttons in front of them, they will earn points. However, Player 2 does not get penalized if putting it in incorrectly. Then Player 2 must start a new round of colors to be shown to Player 1.

The players must be careful because there is a banner in front of the ring that displays a series of colors and texts that are meant to confuse the player. The player who reaches 50 points first will win. However, if no players reach 50 points before the timer is up, both players will lose the game. The players must work together to finish the game.
I decided to create this game because I thought it would be a fun and collaborative yet competitive game to make. 

**Challenging Aspects**

Some things I struggled with was familiarizing myself with how socket.io works. I was a little confused at first on how to apply it to my application in the way I wanted to. I think the confusion stemmed from not using socket.io as soon as I hoped with reading week, midterms and other assignments from other classes. I must have forgotten since the lesson we had on socket.io was a couple weeks ago. Thankfully, there is a video lesson on what we had learned so that helped clear things up! As I mentioned in the last assignment, I had never used JavaScript before, so I was not very familiar with the syntax. However, having done the last assignment, I found myself more comfortable with it. I still was not 100% comfortable with it but I am getting better at it!  

**Aspects that Went Well**

Even though I was not very comfortable with JavaScript and socket.io. I was able to search up a lot of things I wanted to do like simple things that are different from C++ and JavaScript. I also rewatched the lesson on socket.io and emailing you asking questions was helpful too. Overall, I was happy with how the assignment turned out.
